Project Title: Simon Says Game

Project Description: The Simon Says Game is a fun and interactive browser-based memory game inspired by the classic "Simon" electronic game. In this game, players follow a sequence of colors generated by the game and try to replicate it by clicking on the corresponding buttons. As the game progresses, the sequence becomes longer, challenging the player's memory and concentration skills. The game keeps track of the highest score, motivating players to beat their personal best.

Features:

Dynamic Gameplay: The game starts when any key is pressed, initiating the sequence generation and level progression.
Color Buttons: Four distinct color buttons (Red, Yellow, Green, and Purple) serve as the interactive elements for the player to click, each flashing when selected by the game or the player.
Score and Level Display: The current level is displayed, with the highest score achieved being tracked.
Responsive Feedback: Correct sequences increase the level, while a wrong sequence triggers a "Game Over" message, with an option to restart.
Visual Effects: The game features button flash animations and background color changes to enhance feedback and player engagement.
Technologies Used:

HTML & CSS: For creating and styling the layout and button elements, giving each color button a distinct look.
JavaScript: For handling game logic, including sequence generation, event handling, score tracking, and animations.
How to Play:

Press any key to start the game.
Observe the sequence of flashes across the color buttons.
Click the buttons in the same order to match the gameâ€™s sequence.
Progress through levels as you match sequences, with increasing difficulty.
If you make a mistake, the game displays your score, and you can press any key to try again.
File Structure:

index.html: Main HTML file containing the game layout.
simon_game.css: CSS file defining the layout, button styling, and color schemes.
simon_game.js: JavaScript file handling game mechanics, event listeners, animations, and score tracking.
Challenges & Learning: This project demonstrates proficiency in JavaScript for DOM manipulation, event handling, and implementing a memory-based game logic. The use of animations and visual feedback required a creative approach to CSS styling and timed JavaScript functions.
